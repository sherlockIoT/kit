We welcome your input as we work to build a resource that can evolve over time. We welcome your suggestions, comments and questions. \r\n\r\n###What is Sherlock Holmes and the Internet of Things\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes & the Internet of Things is an ongoing prototype developed and run by the Columbia University Digital Storytelling Lab and Learn Do Share @Columbia that explores new forms and functions of storytelling. Designed to be an open R&D space (released under a creative commons license) that experiments with shifts in authorship and ownership of stories, the massive collaboration also uses a detective narrative to examine the policy and ethical issues surrounding the Internet of Things.\r\n\r\nThe goal of Sherlock Holmes & the Internet of Things is to build a massive connected crime scene consisting of smart storytelling objects. This summer and fall teams will create, design, build and test prototypes that will be plugged into a number of crime scenes located around the world.\r\n\r\n###Goals of the project \r\n\r\n    To explore new methods of collaboration\r\n\r\n    To create an open resource for IoT and storytelling \r\n\r\n    To provide a space for global networking \r\n\r\n    To create a learning opportunity that's tied to an actual project\r\n\r\n    To be transparent and share the results of the experiment as we go \r\n\r\n    To create new spaces for Story-driven R&D\r\n\r\n\r\n###A few words to help frame this global collaboration \r\n\r\n    Keep it fun \r\n\r\n    Be kind \r\n\r\n    This is a non judgmental space \r\n\r\n    Listen with intention\r\n\r\n    Speak with passion \r\n\r\n    Embrace Yes And thinking \r\n\r\n    You are in an experiment \r\n\r\n    This is emergent \r\n\r\n    We embrace the fuzzy \r\n\r\n    This is a copyleft project \r\n\r\n    Learn Do Share   ",
