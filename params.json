We welcome your input as we work to build a resource that can evolve over time. We welcome your suggestions, comments and questions. \r\n\r\n###What is Sherlock Holmes and the Internet of Things\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes & the Internet of Things is an ongoing prototype developed and run by the Columbia University Digital Storytelling Lab and Learn Do Share @Columbia that explores new forms and functions of storytelling. Designed to be an open R&D space (released under a creative commons license) that experiments with shifts in authorship and ownership of stories, the massive collaboration also uses a detective narrative to examine the policy and ethical issues surrounding the Internet of Things.\r\n\r\nThe goal of Sherlock Holmes & the Internet of Things is to build a massive connected crime scene consisting of smart storytelling objects. This summer and fall teams will create, design, build and test prototypes that will be plugged into a number of crime scenes located around the world.\r\n\r\n###Goals of the project \r\n\r\nTo explore new methods of collaboration\r\n\r\nTo create an open resource for IoT and storytelling \r\n\r\nTo provide a space for global networking \r\n\r\nTo create a learning opportunity that's tied to an actual project\r\n\r\nTo be transparent and share the results of the experiment as we go \r\n\r\nTo create new spaces for Story-driven R&D\r\n\r\n\r\n###A few words to help frame this global collaboration \r\n\r\nKeep it fun \r\n\r\nBe kind \r\n\r\nThis is a non judgmental space \r\n\r\nListen with intention\r\n\r\nSpeak with passion \r\n\r\nEmbrace Yes And thinking \r\n\r\nYou are in an experiment \r\n\r\nThis is emergent \r\n\r\nWe embrace the fuzzy \r\n\r\nThis is a copyleft project \r\n\r\nLearn Do Share \r\n\r\n\r\n  ",
